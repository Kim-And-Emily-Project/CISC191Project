/*
 * LO8: Construct programs utilizing text file I/O:
 * 
 * 		(The idea is that the completed grocery list will be exported which demonstrates
 * 		File Output. The list of Food Quotes for the UI can be imported as a Text File
 * 		using File Input to demonstrate this particular LO.)
 * 
 * LO5: Construct programs using generic collections and data structures:
 * 
 * 		(The idea is that as the user selects items, those items will be added one at
 * 		a time to a Queue (most likely) since queues utilize FIFO. That way the first
 * 		item added to the list should appear at the top of the exported list, and the
 * 		last item added should appear at the bottom of the list. This should 
 * 		effectively demonstrate LO5.)
 * 
 * LO7: Construct programs utilizing exception handling:
 * 
 * 		(Whenever you work with File I/O, you should work with exceptions. Therefore,
 * 		whenever we attempts to export the completed grocery list, there should be 
 * 		Exception Handlers that deal with the possibility of the export going awry...
 * 		and we need to be able to predict and catch any such errors using Exceptions,
 * 		which in turn will effectively demonstrate LO7.)
